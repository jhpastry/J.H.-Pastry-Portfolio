        <h1>About</h1>
      <p>I make desserts that think as much as they taste.</p>
<p>Every piece begins with a concept that grows into a narrative, becomes an intention, and finally sublimates into a plate of food.</p>
<p>Trained in the precision of Montréal’s fine kitchens, my work lives at the intersection of technique, culture, and emotion — with each piece speaking to both taste and thought.</p>
<p>This site is an archive of curated creations, seasonal musings, and the imperceptible gestures in between each processes.</p>
